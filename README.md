# Cooking Recipes
This web app is used to quickly look throught many food choices and their recipe.

The application also comes with a feature that allows the user to save their favorite meal recipes. The recipes are very straight forward and they are all imported from an API that can be found in [here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).

Here is a quick look at the application.

## Project Goals 
1. To learn how to use APIs and deploy it to a custom website.
2. An API is an application connected to the internet that sends data to the server, we retrieve the data so the users can interact with it. To learn how to utilize APIs with JavaScript click here [JavaScript Fetch API](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-fetch-api/).
3. Use HTML and CSS to create the contents of the page, and the design of the page.
4. Finally once you validated your HTML and CSS make your source code ready for deployment.
5. To deploy it I used https://www.netlify.com/, it is completely free. First sign up for an account and then
   * Connect to Git provider 
   * Pick a repository 
   * Customize your build options and deploy
6. If everything went accordingly to plan your site should be published and your site should be live âœ¨

## How to set a custom domain
If you are on netlify, go to your site overview  <img width="120" alt="Screen Shot 2021-12-03 at 10 18 06 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66978846/144695050-703a5318-45b4-45ad-bdc3-8df73e2a535e.png">  and add a name that is available, ending in the domain .netlify.app.

To choose a domain ending in .com which is a top-level domain, you would have to pay 16$ each year.
