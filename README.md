# Cooking Recipes
This web app is used to quickly look throught many food choices and their recipe.

The application also comes with a feature that allows the user to save their favorite meal recipes. The recipes are very straight forward and they are all imported from an API that can be found in [here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).

Here is a quick look at the application.
